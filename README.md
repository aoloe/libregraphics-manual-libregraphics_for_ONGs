# HOWTO

- Add a two letter language code for each translated file, before the extension and prefixe by a dash (as in `README-de.md`). In
- there is a .sla per language
- the content is created in .md files that are manually imported into the .sla
- the images are also manually inserted
- each section has its own folder that contains, the text for the chapter in a .md file (each translation in one file), the images to be published both in web and print resolution (and eventually translated), the resources used to create the images (in a `resource/` directory), a README.md file with notes about the section and a list of changes and authors per language.
